==Building==

For most of the code, you can get by with just Boost, a C++ compiler, and make. All the other stuff is for the testOgreLearn file, where I'm figuring out how to make the client.

But you should have: Boost, ODE, nvidia-cg extensions, and GDK installed. 

nvidia-cg is for OGRE, and OGRE can be configured to not use it with --disable-cg. I don't use cg in my code, so it should be fine to not have it (I didn't have it for awhile), as long as you get OGRE to build without it.

As far as dependencies of my dependencies, see the respective websites for those projects. 

You need to download and build OGRE and OIS.

untar the tarballs for OGRE and OIS into the directory above evolve, do a "make" (no "make install") and create symbolic links to the directories, or just move them into evolve (but don't commit them if you do!). Symbolic links like so:
{{{
$>ls
evolve
ogrenew
ois
$> cd evolve
$> ln -s ../ogrenew ogrenew
$> ln -s ../ois ois
}}}
The makefiles in evolve reference the libraries and headers created in ogrenew when you do a "make". This way you can download and use ogre and ois without having to figure out how to install them or overwriting existing installations.
I use Eihort, later versions are not compatible. Newer version may require updating the library version numbers in the make files.

Note that Ogre should be configured with freeimage disabled.

./configure --disable-freeimage.

Each directory under evolve has it's own makefiles, with dependencies included from other directories from the GlobalMakeSettings.mk and the GlobalMakeTargets.mk files. 

See MakefileStub for a start on creating a makefile in your own directory.
