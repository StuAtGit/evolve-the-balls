==Building==

You need: Boost, ODE, nvidia-cg extensions, and GDK installed.
You need to download OGRE and OIS and untar the tarballs into the directory above evolve, do a "make" (no "make install") and create symbolic links to the directories, or just move them into evolve. Symbolic links like so:
{{
$>ls
evolve
ogrenew
ois
$> cd evolve
$> ln -s ../ogrenew ogrenew
$> ln -s ../ois ois
}}
The makefiles in evolve reference the libraries and headers created in ogrenew when you do a "make". This way you can download and use ogre and ois without having to figure out how to install them or overwriting existing installations.
I use Eihort, later versions are not compatible. Newer version may require updating the library version numbers in the make files.

Note that Ogre should be configured with freeimage disabled.

./configure --disable-freeimage.

Each directory under evolve has it's own makefiles, with dependencies included from other directories from the GlobalMakeSettings.mk and the GlobalMakeTargets.mk files. 

See MakefileStub for a start on creating a makefile in your own directory.
