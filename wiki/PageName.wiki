 ==Building==

You need: Boost, ODE, nvidia-cg extensions, and GDK installed.
You need to download OGRE and OIS and untar the tarballs into the directory above evolve, do a "make" (no "make install") and link them appropriately. I use Eihort, later versions are not compatible. Newer version may require updating the library version numbers in the make files.

Note that Ogre should be configured with freeimage disabled.

./configure --disable-freeimage.

Each directory under evolve has it's own makefiles, with dependencies included from other directories from the GlobalMakeSettings.mk and the GlobalMakeTargets.mk files. 

See MakefileStub for start on making a makefile in your own directory.
