Makefile generation -> also should generate a *.dep file for configuration
generation script..

Code generation -> inheritance (commonAspect class esp.)

Class to scan directories, and generate structure & object information
 -walk is the method you want!
 -might want to be able to exclude certain directories from scan (like docs..)
 -Or not, doc info might be linked into class information
 -*.dep files needed in each directory listing
 -Dump this in projectInfo directory?

stuClassGenerator should now:
 -use the project information to list non-standard header files (and link to docs?)
 -allow you to specify a folder to write all info too
 -reviewed for anything to let it be more dynamic...
