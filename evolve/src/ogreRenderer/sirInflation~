Sir -
  In "Inflated claims", it would seem that the dicussion of the impact of the level vs the rate of increase of Chinese prices could have been a bit more nuanced. While not an economist by trade, it does seem sensible to me that a lower price level of imports would still exert downward pressure on the prices of local goods (or simply goods not imported from the country with the lower price level in question), even if the price of imports began to rise at a faster rate, as the article asserts. However, in industries not dominated by local goods, for example, in the DVD and garment industries mentioned in the article, a faster rate of price increases could indeed have definite inflationary effects. 
  In the end, though, the overall point that singling out one specific country as the cause of the recent surge in inflation mischaracterises the situation was well made. It is undoubtedly a complicated global problem with complicated global causes.
