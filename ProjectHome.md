## Overview ##

Hmm... not so much anymore.
Moved onto relearning that whole web thing:

http://www.shareplaylearn.net/

Been a few years.. (5-6).. odd what's changed and what hasn't..

This is now mainly offsite storage of the site's code. Nothing exciting, just learning AppEngine and GWT (which is exciting, if my code is not :P). Note that the website code is NOT covered by the same license as the project code.

Keeping this stuff just coz:

Create a 3D world of evolving creatures. (yet another one)

Runs evolver, interpreter, physics as separate processes that talk to each other via sockets. Client does rendering, and possibly physics. Hope to factor out physics to separate process.

Currently the system evolved is an lsystem, and it is interpreted as a sequence of points in 3D space.

Note that the Source tab is now irrelevant: all code drops are done via downloads, and the tree is no longer updated. This is due to the fact that I use git on my local machine for version control, and it is rather awkward to try to use two different version control systems for the same code.

Works on linux with Ogre, ODE, OIS, and boost.
